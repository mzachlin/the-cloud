# Go Get Fit!

Check out our live site at: https://pacific-crag-15504.herokuapp.com/

From the home page, you can use the dropdown menus to enter in a range of times on a given day that you are available to work out.
Once you hit submit, you will be shown the gym slot availability during the time range you selected. 

If you enter your email, you will receive updates when the slots you are tracking become available!

To test locally, clone our repo and run:

$ go build -o bin/go-getting-started -v .

to compile the app.  Next, type in:

$ heroku local web

and navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser to view and test on your own machine.

**NOTE:** You must be connected to the eduroam campus wifi network in order for our site to work.
